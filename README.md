The solar dynamo effect was studied for a small area of the Sun and only a one-dimensional case will be investigated, as a three-dimensional case is too complex for this purpose. Analysis 
was done using the graphical and numerical techniques to examine the behaviour of the magnetic field and velocity of the plasma with respect to time. The streamlines and quiver plot phase 
space offered insights into how the magnitude of the magnetic field and velocity of the plasma influence each other. A contour plot helped visualise the magnitude changes in the magnetic 
field, while the nullclines helped identify fixed stable and unstable solutions. This indicated the values of the magnetic field magnitude and velocity of plasma. It showed whether the 
variables tend towards or away from the equilibrium in the system. The exact solutions to the coupled differential equations was obtained and initial conditions for B and v were varied for 
comparison and analysis.
